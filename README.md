This application allows various customers a a store to interact with a SQL database and manage the inventory of products. A customer will be able to view all of the items the store offers, a manager will be able to view high level information about their store and add inventory, while a supervisor will be able to view some high level information about their store.

As a customer, you will have the ability to select which product you would like to purchase, as well as be presented with the option to purchase the selected product. Your purchase will then be reflected in the database.

As a manager, you will have the ability to view products for sale, view low inventory, add to Inventory, and add a new product. If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app will list every available item, the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities. If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it will list all items with an inventory count lower than five. If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store. If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.

A supervisor will have the ability to view product sales by department or create a new department. When a user selects to view product sales by department, they will be able to view the department_id, department_name, over_head_costs, product_sales, and the total_profit. Creating a new department, will allow the supervisor to do just that. When a new department is created, the over_head_costs will have a default value of 0.00.
